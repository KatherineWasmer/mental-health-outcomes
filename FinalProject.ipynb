Analysis\n","\n","The preprocessing step cannot be overlooked in any machine learning project. We noticed something odd in our initial merging of the global hunger, world happiness, and world mental health datasets: there were many NaN values. Furthermore, many of the countries did not have mental health statistics until 2006, while others started in 1990. We initially assumed this was due to a lack of sampling, and that other countries weren't included until 2006. This was a consequence of not looking close enough at our original data set. Upon further examination, we found that all of the countries in the mental health data set were reported from 1990 to 2017, so we concluded that the problem was due to our merging. \n","\n","We experimented with different types of merging that were expanded upon in class, and we found that the outer merge (our initial approach) and the left merge yielded thousands of NaN values. This was far too risky to impute because it could significantly alter models. However, the right merge only had 341 missing values, which would be very easy to impute considering the scope of the data. However, one of the disadvantages of this new merge was that we had to eschew the global hunger data set altogether. Although this was an excellent predictor to include, the data only showed rates from 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2020, so our timespan was quite limited. \n","\n","Another point of contention was how we originally dropped the NaN values. This also influenced our merge, because we did not consider that some of the country codes may have contained NaN values. Therefore, many country rows were removed from our data set, which did not give us the full scope of what we could analyze. To fix this problem, we modified our program so that the \"Code\" and \"index\" columns were dropped before we dropped the NaN values. \n","\n","We also feature engineered the mental health columns in order to obtain an overall mental health score. For each row for all of the disorder columns, we computed a score based on the quantile the rate belonged to. For instance, if a country-year pair had a schizophrenia rate of 0.21%, it would be above the 50th percentile, so we would give it a score of 3. \n","\n","After computing the scores for each disorder, we applied a function that summed up the scores for all 7 columns, and added a new column with the sum of the scores. This sum ranged from 7 to 28, so we decided to compute the quantiles again, but with categories of \"Low\", \"Medium-Low\", \"Medium-High\", and \"High\". For example, if a row had a total score of 15, it would fall in the \"Medium-Low\" category. \n","\n","We dropped all of the mental health columns so that the only information would be the outcome category. This feature engineering allowed us to create a more effective model, but we also ran into another problem: two of the environmental factors (GDP per capita and lifespan) were highly correlated. Therefore, we had to perform dimension reduction in the form of a PCA to get a less overfitted model.

Interpretation and Results \n","\n","After tuning the hyperparameters of each of the classifiers, the best classifier for each metric has been listed below: \n","\n","- Accuracy: SVM (RBF) - 69.97% $\\approx$ 70%\n","- Precision (macro average): SVM (RBF) - 71%\n","- Precision (weighted average): SVM (RBF) - 71%\n","- Recall (macro average): K-nearest neighbors - 64% \n","- Recall (weighted average): SVM (RBF) - 70%\n","- F1 (macro average): K-nearest neighbors - 65% \n","- F1 (weighted average): Tiebreaker between SVM (RBF) and KNN - 69%\n","\n","When taking all of these metrics into account, our best bet is to use an SVM-RBF classifier with the default values. For 4/7 of these statistics, the percentage exceeds 70%. For accuracy in particular, most machine learning engineers aim for a 70-90% accuracy. (That being said, we believe that our accuracy could increase with more data and considering more data frames to merge).\n","\n","However, accuracy is not the only metric that should be looked at when judging the efficacy of a machine learning model. Precision and recall are especially important. Since the samples are unbalanced (shown by the support values), we want to use the weighted averages instead of the macro averages. The weighted precision for the SVM says that when the model predicts a positive value, the percentage of true positives is 71%, while 29% are false positives. We generally want to get a 70-80% precision rate, so this supports the idea that the SVM is the best model. The weighted recall rate (or positive predictive value) is 70%. \n","\n","This is why it's important to look at a wide variety of metrics, because the accuracy for each models were nearly identical (ranging between roughly 68-70%), but there were noticeable discrepancies in the precision-recall rates. We hope that this model will be a starting point for identifying and resolving factors that negatively impact a population's mental health.
